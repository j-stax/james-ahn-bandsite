## Bandsite

A mock music band website I developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while attending [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp). 
It also uses Axios API to communicate with BrainStation's server to perform CRUD and other operations within the site. I used a responsive web design approach, so the website renders well on
all devices and screen sizes. You can check out the site [here](https://james-ahn-bandsite.netlify.app/).
